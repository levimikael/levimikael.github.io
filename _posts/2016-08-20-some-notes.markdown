WORLD HISTORY TO 1500
<strong>becoming human</strong>
- homo erectus, an "upright" hominid primarily found in asia
- homo sapiens, an ancestor of modern humans, in africa/middle east
  ---> homo sapiens sapiens are modern humans
- homo neanderthalensis in europe

<strong>origins</strong>
- 200,000 yrs ago, homo sapien originated
- 100,000 yrs ago, several types of hominids occupied diff regions

<strong>out of africa</strong>
- homo erectus -> africa -> other regions, evolved independently

<strong>paleolithic period ("stone age")</strong>
- lower- about 2.5 mil yrs ago-200,000 yrs ago
- upper, 40,000 yrs ago, regional stone age tool industries, 
     venus figures (accentuated breasts/hips), cave paintings

<strong>mesolithic period ("middle stone age")</strong>
- better tools, including stone tools on shafts for use as more efficient weapons
- beginning of period varies by location (and by greater development in tools)
- mesolithic is defined by hunter-gatherers, humankind is more successful in types
  of animals hunted, in some cases it decreased the probability of death which occurred
  in hunting dangerous game
- bUrIaL mOuNdS

<strong>revolution, neolithic period ("new stone age")</strong>
- from about 10,000 bce onward its neolithic period 
- neolithic period is categorized by "revolution"
  ---> animal husbandry & emergence of agriculture revolutionized societies (sedentary farming)
- lots of separate "revolutions," occurred independently in diff regions
- earliest intro of sedentary farming was in fertile crescent
- neolithic tech spread to indus river valley by ~5000 bce
- americans entered through beringia, were isolated after ice age, agriculture developed slower

<strong>reasons for farming:</strong>
- ice age started ending, fertile soil! woo! and rain!
- less returns on hunting.. rip in pieces
- easier to obtain food by farming, bc a harvest is guaranteed!

<strong>what about women?</strong>
- women have more demanding jobs in agriculture
- development of gender + patriarchy = bad for women! nooo
