WORLD HISTORY TO 1500
<br><strong>becoming human</strong>
<br>- homo erectus, an "upright" hominid primarily found in asia
<br>- homo sapiens, an ancestor of modern humans, in africa/middle east
<br>  ---> homo sapiens sapiens are modern humans
<br>- homo neanderthalensis in europe

<strong>origins</strong>
<br>- 200,000 yrs ago, homo sapien originated
<br>- 100,000 yrs ago, several types of hominids occupied diff regions

<strong>out of africa</strong>
<br>- homo erectus -> africa -> other regions, evolved independently

<strong>paleolithic period ("stone age")</strong>
<br>- lower- about 2.5 mil yrs ago-200,000 yrs ago
<br>- upper, 40,000 yrs ago, regional stone age tool industries, 
<br>     venus figures (accentuated breasts/hips), cave paintings

<strong>mesolithic period ("middle stone age")</strong>
<br>- better tools, including stone tools on shafts for use as more efficient weapons
<br>- beginning of period varies by location (and by greater development in tools)
<br>- mesolithic is defined by hunter-gatherers, humankind is more successful in types
  of animals hunted, in some cases it decreased the probability of death which occurred
  in hunting dangerous game
<br>- bUrIaL mOuNdS

<strong>revolution, neolithic period ("new stone age")</strong>
<br>- from about 10,000 bce onward its neolithic period 
<br>- neolithic period is categorized by "revolution"
<br>  ---> animal husbandry & emergence of agriculture revolutionized societies (sedentary farming)
<br>- lots of separate "revolutions," occurred independently in diff regions
<br>- earliest intro of sedentary farming was in fertile crescent
<br>- neolithic tech spread to indus river valley by ~5000 bce
<br>- americans entered through beringia, were isolated after ice age, agriculture developed slower

<strong>reasons for farming:</strong>
<br>- ice age started ending, fertile soil! woo! and rain!
<br>- less returns on hunting.. rip in pieces
<br>- easier to obtain food by farming, bc a harvest is guaranteed!

<strong>what about women?</strong>
<br>- women have more demanding jobs in agriculture
<br>- development of gender + patriarchy = bad for women! nooo
